# NUnit Test Adapter for Visual Studio, for NUnit 2.X 

The NUnit Test Adapter only runs NUnit 2.X tests in Visual Studio 2012 and newer. 

Note that it does not run NUnit 3.X tests, for that you need the [NUnit3TestAdapter](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter)

Please consider moving your code to use NUnit3.  This adapter is only maintained to support newer versions of Visual Studio, and is very rarely updated. We might fix an occasional bug if it is critical.
